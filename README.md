# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For my project I choose the grocery store app. This app solved the problem of making usable sense of the a grocery stores raw data.
# What did you do particularly well?
I beleive that what I did well was making the code function and adding some checks to make sure the input was expected input.
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
On review, I may have been able to add more comments. 
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging pieces were getting the txt file loaded. I just had to stick with it and break it down into smaller sections of code. Do to my current job, I already have GitHub, Azure Repos and Pipelines, VS Code, VS Studio and other tools.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Although I do not currently work in C++ it is nice to know that I can if I need too and to have an entrance into this coding language.
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to keep the code simple and include comments where needed.
